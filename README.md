Green Initiative project for learning HTML/CSS.
* In this project I created home page for a static website name "Green Initiative".
* There are one main HTML file "desktop-home.html".
* For styling I used CSS and created separate folder for css file . Inside css folder there is another
  directory for images used in this project. 
* I used relative, Absolute, Flexbox, Grid for positioning.
